# Given a .pgn file containing a single game, attempt to create a series of UCI commands
# for the specified player, which aims to perfectly recreate the game, down to the node.
#
# Bugs, oddities, or just interesting situations, are often seen in PGNs from games played.
# Those games are almost always played with standard Fischer time controls. As a result,
# reproducing those games can be very challenging.
#
# FastChess, and OpenBench's fork of cutechess, supply the node counters most recently
# reported by the playing engine in the PGN. Engines like Torch, which always produce
# a final UCI report at the end of the search, and which have perfect determinism for
# "go nodes <x>", are able to replay games if the exact node counters are known.
#
# This script makes use of a UCI extension, a command called "wait", which will block
# until the current search is done. That allows piping the output of the script, directly
# into an engine as stdin, to set up the engine state.
#
# Suppose that we have a pgn where Torch played an illegal move as white, during an SPRT
# test. We could get a series of commands to reproduce the engine state, up to the final
# search where the illegal move occurred, with the following:
# ./reproduce.py --pgn bug.pgn --white --nodes --option.Hash=16
