# byte-knight

`byte-knight` is a UCI compliant chess engine written in Rust. It started as a port of the chess engine I submitted for Sebatian Lague's [Chess Engine Challenge](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/Leonidas) where it placed in the top 32 out of 600+ entries.

`byte-knight` is under active development and is not yet ready for use.
