`byte-knight` is a UCI compliant chess engine written in Rust. It started as a port of the chess engine I submitted for Sebatian Lague's [Chess Engine Challenge](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/Leonidas) where it placed in the top 32 out of 600+ entries.

You can challenge `byte-knight` yourself on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/byte-knight)!

# Overview

`byte-knight` is my first "real" Rust project. I'm a long time [C++ developer](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=c%2B%2B&sort=stargazers) and have been itching to learn Rust. I really enjoyed participating in the chess challenge a while back and thought that writing a new chess engine from scratch would be a good way to learn the language.

`byte-knight` is a command line chess engine and does not come with any sort of user interface. There are many [chess GUIs](https://www.chessprogramming.org/GUI) out there that you can use like [cutechess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess).

New features are tested via my [OpenBench](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench) [intance](https://developerpaul123.pythonanywhere.com) using [SPRT](https://github.com/jw1912/SPRT/blob/main/SPRT.md#how-sprt-actually-works) testing.

# Features

## Board/Game Representation

- Bitboard board representation
- Magic bitboards for sliding piece attacks
- Zobrist hashing with board state history
- Legal move generator

## Search

- [Iterative deepening](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Iterative_Deepening)
- [Negamax](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Negamax) with alpha/beta pruning
- [Quiescence search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Quiescence_Search)
- [Transposition Table](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table)
- [Principle variation search](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Principal_Variation_Search)
- [Aspiration windows](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Aspiration_Windows)

  - [History heuristic](https://www.chessprogramming.org/History_Heuristic) with history gravity

## Evaluation

- Piece square tables with tapered evaluation using [PeSTO](https://www.chessprogramming.org/PeSTO%27s_Evaluation_Function) values.
  - Project includes an HCE tuner based on [jw1912/hce-tuner](https://github.com/jw1912/hce-tuner)

## UCI

[UCI](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI) is a standard protocol for chess engines. `byte-knight` implements the following commands:

- `uci`
- `ucinewgame`
- `isready`
- `position <fen> moves <move list>`
- `go`
  - `depth <depth>`
  - `nodes <nodes>`
  - `wtime <wtime> btime <btime> winc <winc> binc <binc>`
- `stop`
- `quit`

## Other Commands

To see all commands that `byte-knight` supports, type:

```bash
byte-knight help
```

To see all options for a given command, type `byte-knight <cmd> --help`.

- `bench` - This runs a fixed depth search on a variety of positions. This is used by [OpenBench](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench) for scaling based on engine performance.

## UCI Options

| Name | Value Range | Default | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Hash | [1 - 1024] | 16      | Set the TT table size in MB |
| Threads | [1]      | 1       | How many threads to use in search |

# Build and Run

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

# Development Dependencies

To run the full suite of supported tests, benchmarks and other development dependencies, you will need the following tools (in addition to Rust and Cargo):
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- Rust llvm-profdata component
  - Install with `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`
- [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) (Used to generate code coverage reports)
- [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) (Required for `genhtml` to create HTML reports from `lcov` data)
